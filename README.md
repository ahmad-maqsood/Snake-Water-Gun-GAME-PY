Snake, Water, Gun (Python)
A simple, interactive command-line implementation of the classic Snake, Water, Gun game (a variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors) developed as part of my Python learning journey.

🎮 How to Play
The game follows these rules:

●Snake drinks Water (Snake wins)
●Water douses Gun (Water wins)
●Gun kills Snake (Gun wins)

✨ Features:
●Dynamic Opponents: The computer randomly selects a name from a list of predefined opponents.
●Score Tracking: Keeps track of both the player's and the computer's score across multiple rounds.
●Input Validation: Ensures the player enters a valid move ('s', 'w', or 'g').
●Persistent Gameplay: Players can choose to continue playing as many rounds as they like until they decide to quit.
